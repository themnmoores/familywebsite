The couple to the left of Julie was another Pygmy Elephant group (we ran into others) that were from North Carolina.

Pushing or carrying a bike on many of the trail sections seemed like a lot of work versus just walking. It was also unnerving to have mountain bikers come up behind you on the trail and not even warn you."},{"src":"photo_20180925_204423.jpg","caption":"Julie picking her way up the hill, we did not make it to the top before the sun greeted us but we were a good 80 percent of the way up and there was a gentle breeze."},{"src":"photo_20180925_204320.jpg","caption":"Finally started to get some views.

We went to the left just below the snow fences. The old TMB, the high route, continues up to the top of the ridge. One guide we talked to at Rifugio Giorgio Bertone said the views were pretty much the same and the lower route was less work.

We ended up climbing up the creek bed (with water) on the left side as the right side was very slick mud over rock. Once we got to the top a big group came from the other direction and we tried to tell them to go down the creek bed. The first women of the group tired to go down the mud covered rock but slipped and fell down with her leg buckling under her. I was sure her leg was going to break but she was able to get up after her slide. The rest of the group ignored our advice and climbed down backwards on the slippery rock. We left before they all went down as it was too stressful to watch."},{"src":"photo_20180925_203540.jpg","caption":"Many sections the trail were washed out and marginal."},{"src":"photo_20180925_203350.jpg","caption":"Julie said, did you see the old man in the rock?
