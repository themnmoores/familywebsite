This cut a couple of miles from the day of hiking that would have been hiking along the road. A smart decision considering how difficult our day of hiking was."},{"src":"photo_20180921_203148.jpg","caption":"Inside Eglise de notre Dame de la Gorge"},{"src":"photo_20180921_203103.jpg","caption":"4 hours to the first Col (Col du Bonhomme) we would climb to. Throughout our trip Darrell and Brennan were well ahead of the listed times, and Julie and I we usually 10-15 percent faster than the times. This meant that with a lunch break and rest breaks Julie and I would arrive a little ahead of the listed time for our daily hikes."},{"src":"TMB_day3.jpg","caption":"Our route for the day. To me this turned out to be the hardest hike of the trip. With 4280 vertical feet over the first 8 miles it seemed you would never stop climbing. Many of the blogs and videos I looked at considered this the most boring part of the TMB. I am not sure if they hiked the same trail as we did, but this was another spectacular section of the trail."},{"src":"photo_20180921_203003.jpg","caption":"The owner of the hotel we stayed at, who was a ultra distance trail runner, told us that the trail out of the church trailhead was very steep but not to worry that after a while it would level out and be easier. He was right about the very steep in the beginning part, but the trail was very steep in many of the following sections and not particularly easy. What amazed me is that these are 4WD roads which the locals drive regularly. "},{"src":"photo_20180921_203033.jpg","caption":"Looking up the first road section, Darrell and Brennan taking off.

Julie is smiling still!!!"},{"src":"photo_20180921_204000.jpg","caption":"Refuge de la Croix du Bonhomme, many folks we talked with had stayed here with mixed emotions. Some thought it was good, many not so good. I went in to see about getting some food and after looking at the unclean conditions settled on a beer instead. We had a nice picnic lunch from our hotel (that I had carried up the hill). We found it best to order one picnic lunch for us to share on the trail instead of trying to rely on getting food at the refuges. That way we could eat wherever we wanted and not have to wait for service. Picnic lunches were from 8-14 euros."},{"src":"photo_20180921_204113.jpg","caption":"Julie having some sips of beer and enjoying the baguette sandwich from our picnic lunch while Darrell (who had finished his beer and eaten some of his trail gorp) looked on.

Looked pretty good from the outside and was okay inside. We all felt this was lowest on the list of places we stayed. We did have a private room with two twin beds, but it was small! There was a half bath with a private shower and sink, but we shared a toilet with the other 10 rooms on our floor. The room was so small we put our luggage on the beds during the day and then at night in the half bath so we could walk through the room. Also the shared toilet was outside our room and of course the door was hard to shut so we heard people slamming the door shut all night long going to the bathroom."},{"src":"photo_20180921_195134.jpg","caption":"Auberge Refuge Nova, Darrell relaxing.

We arrived about 2:30 well ahead of the crowds to come. This was the most isolated section of our TMB, as there was no cell service and you had to buy internet time at the store behind Brennan (2 euros for 30 minutes, but at least it was fast)."}]}'
