We were expecting 8 some miles and it turned out to be almost 10. What really added to hardness was the last 4 miles being uphill, in the sun, and it was getting really warm towards the end. I know I was getting ready for it to be over about mile 8. Otherwise, it was a great walk, especially the first part down the valley. Many folks bypass this section by taking the bus to Champex, but I am glad we hiked as it added some new experiences to our TMB."},{"src":"photo_20180929_204125.jpg","caption":"Much of the first 7 miles was on roads, paved and dirt.
