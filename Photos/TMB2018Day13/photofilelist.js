The normal TMB would have us backtrack above Le Planet and hike the ridge to the ladders section of the TMB. Julie and I had decided not to do the ladders, and our local contact said the alternative high route was closed due to rock slides and he even cautioned against the ladders due to unsettled geology. Our revised route allowed us to meet Darrell\'s wife Audrey and her sister Charlotte and her husband John at the cable car and they would join us for the second leg on our hike to Lac Blanc."},{"src":"photo_20181009_203318.jpg","caption":"Heading out of Argentiere."},{"src":"photo_20181009_203247.jpg","caption":"The path became a trail that in TMB fashion was up and down."},{"src":"photo_20181009_203216.jpg","caption":"And a bit rocky at times."},{"src":"photo_20181009_203142.jpg","caption":"Morning light coming over the ridge into the Chamonix valley."},{"src":"photo_20181009_201334.jpg","caption":"This section looked like something out of the Lord of the Rings and we expected trolls or orcs to come out at any time (or maybe a hobbit)."},{"src":"photo_20181009_201303.jpg","caption":"No orcs, trolls or hobbits to be found."},{"src":"photo_20181009_203054.jpg","caption":"The walk down the valley was a nice stroll in the cool shade of the morning."},{"src":"photo_20181009_203019.jpg","caption":"Walking through the Golf Club de Chamonix"},{"src":"photo_20181009_202937.jpg","caption":"Along the road to the cable car around the corner."},{"src":"TMB_day13_part2.jpg","caption":"The second leg of our hike was planned to Lac Blanc. We did a combination of routes. Julie and I hiked up from the top of the cable car while Darrell and folks took the chairlift up and hiked along the ridge. Our guide had said the ridge hike was moderate and it was a pretty rough hike for moderate. The route Julie and I took turned out to be the hardest hiking of our trip and was quite the rock scramble at times starting at 1 1/2 miles into the hike."},{"src":"photo_20181009_202907.jpg","caption":"Waiting for the cable car ride."},{"src":"photo_20181009_202809.jpg","caption":"At the top of the cable car and ready for leg 2."},{"src":"photo_20181009_202728.jpg","caption":"Of course it would be up, but it looked like a pretty good trail from the intial trail section we could see."},{"src":"photo_20181009_202653.jpg","caption":"Darrell and folks took the chairlift in the upper right of the picture."},{"src":"photo_20181009_202607.jpg","caption":"Still feeling pretty good."},{"src":"photo_20181009_201117.jpg","caption":"Not too bad, I figured the trail would be pretty good since this is an iconic hike that many people do."},{"src":"photo_20181009_201155.jpg","caption":"Just had to keep looking back to enjoy the cloud free view."},{"src":"photo_20181009_202454.jpg","caption":"The trail was getting a bit more difficult but manageable."},{"src":"photo_20181009_202256.jpg","caption":"Mont Blanc again."},{"src":"photo_20181009_202528.jpg","caption":"From here the trail became hard to follow and quite steep."},{"src":"photo_20181009_202423.jpg","caption":"In some sections it was just a rock scramble and a bit unnerving."},{"src":"photo_20181009_202217.jpg","caption":"And steeper, we had to get to the peak where you can see a person against the blue sky.
