As time seemed essential Julie and I were able to get shuttle about two miles up the canyon to La Ville des Glaciers. We thought we had an 8:30 shuttle arranged with the taxi company, but La Nova did not have any record of that and the only shuttle left was the 7:30. We slammed down breakfast and grabbed the 7:30 shuttle. This worked out to our benefit as a steady rain started just as we arrived at Refugio Elisabetta meaning we would have been hiking in an hour of rain without the shuttle."},{"src":"photo_20180922_210337.jpg","caption":"All ready to hit the trail."},{"src":"TMB_day4_DarrellBrennan.jpg","caption":"Darrell and Brennan decided to skip a shuttle and walk the whole route.

Luckily being early to the refugio meant we got hot showers I heard others complaining that there was no hot water later."}]}'
