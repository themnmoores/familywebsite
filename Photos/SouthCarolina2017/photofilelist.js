We fought our way through Atlanta and arrived very worn out in Savannah at 9pm. Only enough energy for a glass of wine at the hotel bar and then to bed. We should have taken the northern route throw Asheville."},{"src":"IMG_20171014_110108749.jpg","caption":"Day 3: Savannah, Forsyth Park on a Saturday"},{"src":"P1010455.JPG","caption":"Day 3: Savannah, Forsyth Park"},{"src":"IMG_20171014_110641587.jpg","caption":"Day 3: Savannah, Forsyth Park Civil War Monument"},{"src":"IMG_20171014_111913074.jpg","caption":"Day 3: Savannah, Forsyth Park Fountain"},{"src":"P1010464.JPG","caption":"Day 3: Savannah, Forsyth Park Fountain"},{"src":"IMG_20171014_114406417.jpg","caption":"Day 3: Savannah"},{"src":"IMG_20171014_114534949.jpg","caption":"Day 3: Savannah"},{"src":"IMG_20171014_113213502_HDR.jpg","caption":"Day 3: Savannah, Mercer Williams House of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil fame."},{"src":"P1010481.JPG","caption":"Day 3: Savannah"},{"src":"P1010474.JPG","caption":"Day 3: Savannah, Armstrong Junior College"},{"src":"IMG_20171014_122719267.jpg","caption":"Day 3: Savannah, the Cathedral of St John the Baptist after noon Mass."},{"src":"P1010486.JPG","caption":"Day 3: Savannah, the Cathedral of St John the Baptist."},{"src":"IMG_20171014_124546883_HDR.jpg","caption":"Day 3: Savannah, City Market"},{"src":"IMG_20171014_125647135.jpg","caption":"Day 3: Savannah, lunch at Sorry Charlie\'s Oyster Bar (amazing).
