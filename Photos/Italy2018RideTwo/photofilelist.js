According to VBT:  another award-winning country hotel famous for the quality of the food. The estate extends over 150 acres and includes a secret garden planted with orange and lemon trees, as well as a well-preserved underground oil mill. Your hosts Armando and his wife Rosalba have collected many interesting odds and ends over the years, from ancient dresses and hats to precious books and a gramophone. The ride was routed mostly on secondary roads that wound through olive orchards and fields. We would ride uphill and then back down as we wove our way through the countryside. With the wildflowers in bloom it was a very pleasant and peaceful ride."},{"src":"photo_20181118_190729.jpg","caption":"Our guides Marco and Guiliano giving the group directions and information about our rides for the day.

I took the longer option that went near the hill city of Ostuni. The others rode a route that connected with my route at about mile 12 giving them a 11 mile ride back. As you can see I did take a wrong exit out of a traffic circle. Voice guided directions were nice except when you were going downhill at a pretty decent speed with heavy traffic. Wind and traffic noise would make it impossible to hear direction cues. I was not able to convince anybody to join me for the ride so I went solo. Marco our guide did come back out and joined me for the last 3 miles. Even though I was solo, Guiliano did come by 3-4 times in the van to check on me starting at about mile 10.
