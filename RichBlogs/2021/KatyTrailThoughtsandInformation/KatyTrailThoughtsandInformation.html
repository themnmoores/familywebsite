<p class="c1"><span class="c10">Katy Trail Thoughts and Information</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">April 23, 2021</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Richard Moore</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">I figured I would write up some thoughts and information about the Katy Trail based on our recent bicycle riding trip on the trail in hopes that it will help others looking to ride this beautiful trail.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">What is a realistic distance to do each day?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">We had a gentleman stop and ask us this question as he was getting ready to ride from Clinton to St Charles in a few weeks. I would say it depends on what your goal is and how far you usually ride. Our goal for a ride such as this is to enjoy the sights along the way and not kill ourselves physically. Also, my passion is photography and video so I tend to stop and take pictures and video as we ride. We typically ride about 30 miles daily regularly and will go 40 miles in a day if we are doing a multi-day ride. Our original itinerary was to ride the trail in 6 days and take a rest day in Herman to enjoy the town and wineries. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Day 1 Clinton to Sedelia (40 miles)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Day 2 Sedalia to Boonville (37 miles)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Day 3 Boonville to Jefferson City (55 miles)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Day 4 Jefferson City to Herman (50 miles)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Day 5 Rest Day, Herman (wineries)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Day 6 Herman to Augusta (40 miles)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Day 7 Augusta to St Charles (30 miles, maybe more)</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">We knew the two 50 mile days would be a stretch and they would have for us. As it turned out, day 3 was an all day rain day so we decided to only do 18 miles from Boonville to Rocheport as we did not want to sit in the Holiday Inn Express in Boonville all day. We were able to get a room at the Katy Trail Bed and Breakfast and move our hotel reservations in Jefferson City to the next day and cut our stay in Herman to one night. This turned out to be a very wise decision as riding 50+ miles on a very soft trail in a cold and driving rain would have been no fun. It also allowed us to enjoy the beautiful section of the trail between Rocheport and Jefferson City on a sunny clear day.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">I would recommend being realistic on your mileage and having some flexibility in your schedule for weather or other issues. The gentleman we talked to was planning on doing it in 4 days which would mean 60 mile days. The only issue I thought he might have is finding a place to stay on day one between Sedalia and Boonville. Also, remember this is a crushed limestone trail and your speed will be reduced from a paved trail.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">What is the trail like?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">The Katy trail for most of the trail is crushed limestone and we found it to be in very good condition for most of the trail. Some trail sections are more of a packed rock base that was a bit harder to ride (northeast of Sedalia heading out of town). Interestingly, the section of the trail between Jefferson City and McKittrick (Herman) seemed to be the least maintained and least traveled. The trail does get soft when it rains and can make for hard going. The section between Windsor and the highest point of the trail was very soft from a lot of rain the day before we rode and just maintaining a 6-7 MPH pace was very hard and grueling. We found the trail recovered from rain quickly and by waiting until 10 am the day after a substantial rain was usually enough for the trail to be firm and rolling nicely. Just beware that you will take about a 20% speed reduction on a crushed limestone/rock trail from a paved trail. I would say the Katy is the best maintained crushed limestone trail we have biked on.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">What about detours or bad trail sections?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">We had to detour twice on our trip. The first was west of Rocheport and required almost 3 miles of nerve wracking riding on Highway 40. It was raining pretty hard when we did that detour and while almost all the cars were courteous and moved over to give us some room we had one big white pickup truck move closer to us, even though there was no oncoming traffic, and almost hit my wife&rsquo;s pannier. If Salt Creek is low people say you can wade and push your bike across a cement path. The creek was pretty swollen with the days of rain when we went through. The second detour is west of Portland and requires about 1 mile of riding on Highway 94. I am happy to report we did not even see a car and the detour is flat and has good sightlines. The Highway 40 detour requires you to go across a very narrow bridge and climb a fairly steep incline to start the detour coming from the west. Here are the Ride with GPS routes for the days we did detours.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9"><a class="c8" href="https://ridewithgps.com/trips/65279953">https://ridewithgps.com/trips/65279953</a></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9"><a class="c8" href="https://ridewithgps.com/trips/65398887">https://ridewithgps.com/trips/65398887</a></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">I cannot remember any really bad trail sections from our ride and the trail was in good condition.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">What are some sights that are worth seeing on or near the trail?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">We did not venture too far from the trail except when our lodging was away from the trail. The nice thing about the Katy Trail is that there are many signs and information about history and points of interest to keep you busy. There is so much on the trail to see and learn about. The town of Rocheport is definitely worth a stop and ride through, and a meal. The spur into Jefferson City is quite the ride over the bridge and you get a very nice view of the capitol building. We had to do that anyway as we were spending the night in Jefferson City. I would say a detour into Herman is a must do. Herman is a very quaint and nice town with drinking and eating for every taste. We stayed in Herman and our first stop after a 49 mile day was the beautiful Hermannhof Winery. The rides into both Jefferson City and Herman are safe and mostly on pavement. We enjoyed the Augusta Winery in Augusta. Our last night on the trail was in Augusta. There is quite a climb up from the trail to the town of Augusta itself.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Many of the town areas are away from the trail so we did not go looking around. Driving back to Clinton we did see that the towns of Windsor and Calhoun were much bigger than they seemed from the trail.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Where did you stay?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">We stayed in hotels and Bed and Breakfasts during our trip. We like having a comfortable room and bed to enjoy after a day of riding.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Clinton: Hampton Inn. This was a very nice hotel and the staff was very helpful and friendly. They let us park our car there for the week which was nice and reassuring. The hotel is about 2 miles from the trailhead which added to our mileage for the day. We took our bicycles into the room.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Sedalia: Hampton Inn. Newly remodeled, the rooms were very nice. The staff was somewhat helpful, but the breakfast was sparse. The location is a bit from the trail but the roads there are more residential unless you miss a turn and end up on Highway 50 as we did. People were very courteous of us. The location is also a bit from most of the restaurants in town. Took our bicycles into the room.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Boonville: Holiday Inn Express. Just okay, could use a serious updating. The staff was very helpful and we were able to do laundry there. I did not really see anything else for lodging that might have been better. The location is devoid of eating places besides Arbys and Wendys so we settled for take out from Arbys and beer from the gas station. Took our bicycles into the room.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Rocheport: Katy Trail Bed and Breakfast. Rocheport is a great little town to stay in and this Bed and Breakfast was wonderful. The owner, Susan, allowed us to check in early when we arrived at 1 like wet dogs and also let us use the dryer to dry our clothes. The location is right in town and easy access to dining. They have a very nice bicycle shed with bike racks that we locked our bikes up to.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Jefferson City: Marriott Courtyard. A brand new hotel that is very nice. We ended up with a room that had a view of the capitol building when the TV in our first room did not work (critical as the final round of the Masters was underway). They stored our bikes for us and had them ready the next morning for us. We ate at the bistro there on the patio with a view of the capitol building. Just beware, there is no free breakfast. The breakfast at the hotel was very good and reasonably priced.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Herman: Herman Crown Suites. A nice big room that was good but not great. Seems like renovation is still ongoing. We enjoyed the basement bar area after dinner out. &nbsp;Have a locking room to store bikes in. Just beware that Herman does not have much open on Mondays and Tuesdays and the places that are open close up pretty early.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Augusta: Red Brick Inn. What a treat, this is a beautiful place to stay. The room was huge and we had the whole inn to ourselves. They stored our bikes in the garage. Breakfast was wonderful and sitting on the back deck drinking some Augusta winery wine was relaxing. Just beware that during the early week Monday-Thursday there is really no place to eat dinner in Augusta. We ended up getting to Augusta a bit before 3 to find out the place we were planning on eating had closed down a week earlier. Luckily, we were able to get some cheese, salami, crackers, and a bottle of white wine at the August winery. That ended up being our late lunch/early dinner for the day.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">St Charles: Drury Inn. We love staying at Drury Inns when we travel and this one is 0.8 miles from the Bike Stop Cafe and Katy Trailhead. A very nice place and the Streets of St Charles area next to it was a good place for a trip end dinner. An easy ride or walk from Old St Charles.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Where did you eat?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">How hard is it to get food and water along the trail?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">What about parking and/or shuttles?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">We parked our car at the Clinton Hampton Inn and that worked out very well. To get back to Clinton from St Charles we rented a minivan for $200 from the St Louis Airport and the Uber ride from the Drury Inn to the rental lot was $18 plus tip. We dropped the rental at the Kansas City Airport as we were heading back to Minnesota. From looking at Google Maps it seems you could ride your bike to the rental lot if you so desired. Amtrak seemed like a bit of a hassle and you still had to get from Sedalia to Clinton. There is a shuttle from St Charles to Clinton that would have worked, but with COVID we were not comfortable being a van with others for 4+ hours. The cost of the shuttle looks like it would be a minimum of $150 for the two of us up to a maximum of $350 depending on how many people besides us were taking the shuttle on a particular day.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">What type of bike is good for the Katy Trail?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">First of all, I would say a road bike with narrow wheels would not be good. We have older, metal frame hybrid bikes. Mine is an old (2002) Trek 7200 and Julie&rsquo;s is a Gary Fisher women&rsquo;s bike (Gary Fisher was bought by Trek) that is dimensioned like a men&rsquo;s bike and rides more comfortably for her as she is 5&rsquo; 10&rdquo;. Our bikes worked well and felt sturdy with the extra load of our gear. A few days before we left I switched our tires from the 28mm Kenda tires we use to 35mm Michelin Protek Max tires. This proved to be a good decision and I think we would have had problems with the narrower tires. I had read and heard many people talk about getting flats on the Katy Trail so that is why I got the Max tires, and we also always use Sunlite thorn resistant tubes. No problems for us with flats. We run with 80 PSI in the tires.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">From what I could see, the bike of choice seems to be a gravel bike which makes sense. Having never ridden on I am not sure how they would do with a rack and load on them. I could see that a mountain bike with more of a road tire on it might be a good choice. On our first day when the trail was soft I was wishing I had my fat tire bike. A fat tire would be overkill, but I could see one working if you had road tires that were pumped up in pressure.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">What planning resources did you use?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">The websites</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7 c11"><span class="c14"><a class="c8" href="https://bikekatytrail.com/">https://bikekatytrail.com/</a></span></p><p class="c2 c11"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c7 c11"><span class="c14"><a class="c8" href="https://mostateparks.com/park/katy-trail-state-park">https://mostateparks.com/park/katy-trail-state-park</a></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Were useful, the bikekatytrail very much so.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">The Facebook group &nbsp;&ldquo;KATY Trail Rider Group&rdquo; was very useful.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c7 c11"><span class="c14"><a class="c8" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/615471375669169/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/615471375669169/</a></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Other than that, we watched YouTube videos of others riding the Katy Trail. Interestingly, these videos did not capture the incredible beauty of the trail. Not sure why, but I am hoping my videos are able to capture what I saw.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">https://youtu.be/h-7g5MkWpBE</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">https://youtu.be/pygxMGM8Bxw</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">https://youtu.be/4CpAVpdh_K4</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c14"><a class="c8" href="https://youtu.be/iaKdbwoSAcg">https://youtu.be/iaKdbwoSAcg</a></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">https://youtu.be/4nPefcp0JsQ</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">https://youtu.be/dcMJSIUexLo</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">https://youtu.be/_n3oMZSd6aU</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">https://youtu.be/f0sGqMdNpBQ</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">https://youtu.be/E1lFrJ7x7dg</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c9"><a class="c8" href="https://youtu.be/-5q1hK1levY">https://youtu.be/-5q1hK1levY</a></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c9"><a class="c8" href="https://youtu.be/iY7gTbTYwvo">https://youtu.be/iY7gTbTYwvo</a></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">I also rely heavily on Ride with GPS for preroute planning and Google Maps with Satellite data to check our roads and towns. It is nice to walk your planned path with the street view feature especially for bigger cities. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">When is a good time to bike the Katy?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c13">Being from Minnesota we like to find places we can kick off our biking season early and enjoy some warmer weather. Our April trip (9-14) turned out to be a good window. We had two days of rain and low 50 temperatures but the other days were sunny beautiful days in the high 60s to low 70s. Interestingly, the week after we rode the weather could considerably colder and they had snow along the Katy. For flowers and trees we were a bit early but we were still treated to flowers and very green grass. The nice thing was that the brush had not filled in with leaves so we were able to see much more than you would in the summer. I would think early May would be a good target if you wanted a good spring experience. For us, summer was not an option as we both do not enjoy biking in hot, humid weather. I could imagine fall is a nice time, but it seems to be a popular time on the trail. No matter when you go, you will most likely have some rain so be prepared.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">Copyright 2021, Richard J.
