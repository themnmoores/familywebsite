<p class="c4"><span class="c0">Top Books of 2016</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">January 10, 2017</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Richard Moore</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Every since I have been young, reading books has been a great passion and escape into other worlds and places. These days I tend to prefer nonfiction books that immerse me in real life adventures and stories. Well done historical fiction, well researched and factual, is always fun since it transforms me into an historical period without boring me to death with just facts and figures. </span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The following is my top 5 books for the categories of nonfiction, fiction(4), and religious/spirituality. </span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Nonfiction</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The Grape Series (My Grape Year, My Grape Escape, My Grape Village), Laura Bradbury</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maybe a bit of cheating here, but these three books really need to be read in order and make a great adventure (I just realized there are now 4 books in the series, My Grape Wedding was just published last summer and I will be reading it in 2017). I really enjoyed the honest look at a west coast Canadian going to France in high school and her struggles to learn the language and adjust to a radically different culture. Fun reads and an education into the culture, food, wine, and way of life in France.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amazon:</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="http://amzn.to/2j3b0vo">http://amzn.to/2j3b0vo</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="http://amzn.to/2iQ0dF6">http://amzn.to/2iQ0dF6</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="http://amzn.to/2i4Mhbi">http://amzn.to/2i4Mhbi</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Adventures on the Wine Route: A Wine Buyer&rsquo;s Tour of France, Kermit Lynch</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A really educational book on the wines of France and the business of buying and importing wine. Amazing stories of the winemakers he befriends and tries to convince to allow him to import their wines. Well written and you feel like you are in the old cellars with these old school winemakers tasting bottles of different vintages. If you like wine this book will be a great read and was a wonderful way to learn much more about wine especially the French aspects of wine making and selling.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amazon:</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="http://amzn.to/2iUfDuo">http://amzn.to/2iUfDuo</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Just Mercy, A Story of Justice and Redemption, Bryan Stevenson</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A must read, but be prepared to be shocked and pissed off by the injustice of the southern judicial system. A Harvard law graduate dedicates his life to defending death row inmates in Alabama and eventually around the United States. A look into just how bad the system is and the injustice of death row.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amazon:</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="http://amzn.to/2iPVqmV">http://amzn.to/2iPVqmV</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban, Malala Yousafzai</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Quite a well written book that takes you through her life and the progression of how the Taliban was able to get a stronghold into Pakistan. Does a great job of allowing you to see the strong faith life of a muslim family in Pakistan and how their dreams of educating the youth of their area was completed wiped out. For those that are interested and open to learning about muslim life in Pakistan a must read.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amazon:</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="http://amzn.to/2i4FrD0">http://amzn.to/2i4FrD0</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The Wild Muir: Twenty-Two of John Muir&#39;s Greatest Adventures, Lee Stetson</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An interesting collection of writings from America&rsquo;s famous outdoorsman. I was amazed how he would head out into the woods with very little gear and food on some very strenuous adventures. A good way to become more familiar with his life and wanderings.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amazon:</span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="http://amzn.to/2i2LdBI">http://amzn.to/2i2LdBI</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Fiction (Like I said, I do not read a lot of fiction this days and only read four in 2016)</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Oil and Marble: A Novel of Leonardo and Michelangelo, Stephanie Storey</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A great historical fiction novel. I cannot say how accurate the story is but it does take you into 1500 Florence and the rivalry between Leonardo Da Vinci and Michelangelo. You feel like you are right there with these two genesis as they create their masterpieces amidst the turmoil and politics of their times. Seems very well researched and the storytelling is captivating. Amazingly this is the only book from this author I see on Amazon, I am looking forward to reading future books from this talented author. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amazon:</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="http://amzn.to/2iOfyIc">http://amzn.to/2iOfyIc</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto, Mitch Albom</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Does Mitch Albom ever write a bad book? This one is really different, but really grabs you and sucks you in. As always Albom&rsquo;s books border on the spiritual side and this one is no exception. Does weave in some Spanish history, but I would not consider it historical fiction. It was amusing to read references to our Parish&rsquo;s Saint, Saint Pascal Baylon, in the book. Another wonderfully done book, and if you want to read something quite different give it a try.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amazon:</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="http://amzn.to/2ioGyLn">http://amzn.to/2ioGyLn</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Breakfast With Buddha, Roland Merullo</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This book will have you laughing out loud. A mysterious guru meets a non believer for a road trip and the results are humorous while making you think deeper. The yoga class chapter had me laughing till I cried.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amazon:</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="http://amzn.to/2i2H2FS">http://amzn.to/2i2H2FS</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Medicus: A Novel of the Roman Empire (Gaius Petreius Ruso Mystery Series Book 1), Ruth Downie</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Since I did not read all that much fiction in 2016 this book by default made the top 4 list of fiction books. I had read book three in the series a few years ago and decided to try the first book. The author does a very good job in researching and presenting the time period of her novels and I enjoyed that aspect of the book, but at times I found the book a bit tedious. Maybe I am not much of a murder mystery person.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amazon:</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="http://amzn.to/2iUageS">http://amzn.to/2iUageS</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">Religious/Spirituality</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The Divine Dance: The Trinity and Your Transformation, Richard Rohr</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is an amazing book with a very progressive look at a Trinitarian God. Maybe what is more amazing is the references in the book to Trinitarian God theology that is 100&rsquo;s of year old, but forgotten or ignored. Really expanded my understanding of what God as three persons encompasses, and how to live a life centered in the Trinity. Still trying to digest this book as I finished it December 31. I have the feeling that a repeat read or two will be required. If you want to really dive into the Trinity and are not scared of letting go of many preconceived notions this is a highly recommended read.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amazon:</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="http://amzn.to/2iPWaZt">http://amzn.to/2iPWaZt</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The Genesee Diary: Report From a Trappist Monastery, Henri Nouwen</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not many of us can take 6 months to live in a monastery, but reading this book can take you inside the monastic lifestyle and experience Nouwen&rsquo;s struggles to grow closer to God. His struggles were so similar to my struggles in growing closer to God that I had to laugh and shake my head in self realization many times. Really enjoyed this book and was disappointed that my time in the monastery had to come to an end when I finished it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amazon:</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="http://amzn.to/2j31qsl">http://amzn.to/2j31qsl</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The Name of God Is Mercy, Pope Francis</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am a really big fan of Pope Francis and his first book as Pope does not disappoint. Found it to be a very honest and revealing book that pushes us to really live the Gospel of Jesus in the real world. His many stories of ministering to and accepting those on the edges really brought home the concept of mercy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amazon:</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="http://amzn.to/2i2L9Sh">http://amzn.to/2i2L9Sh</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Breath of God: Living a Life Led by the Holy Spirit, Dave Pivonka</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fr. Dave Pivonka has a way of leading you deeper into a life with the Holy Spirit. Something many Catholics and other Christians are not comfortable with or do not want. He has a simple way of writing that bring real world experiences into the mix. The central message is that once you are immersed into a life centered on the Holy Spirit it is messy and full of surprises, but in a beautiful way that reveals God more fully.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amazon:</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="http://amzn.to/2iOgs7y">http://amzn.to/2iOgs7y</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The Legends of the Jews - Volumes 1 and 2</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Must admit I have not read all of these, but only selected sections to dive deeper into Jewish thought on certain Old Testament (Torah) readings. Very fascinating to see the elaboration on well known biblical stories to try and address unanswered questions. Even better is that it is a free Kindle download from Amazon. Makes a good homiletics reference.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amazon:</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="http://amzn.to/2i2HiFb">http://amzn.to/2i2HiFb</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Free ebooks:</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="http://amzn.to/2i4Yb59">http://amzn.to/2i4Yb59</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="http://amzn.to/2iOnpFI">http://amzn.to/2iOnpFI</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Happy Reading!</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Copyright 2017, Richard J.
