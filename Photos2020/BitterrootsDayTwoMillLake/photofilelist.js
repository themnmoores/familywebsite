We had a bit of climbing to do in getting to the first of four lakes for our day. Our plan was to get to Fred Burr Lake and do some fishing and then maybe fish Lockwood and Heinrich Lake before ending at Mill Lake. We had good fishing at Fred Burr Lake during a lunch break and opted to skip the other two lakes to get to Mill Lake and get some trout for dinner. That was a bad decision as fish were rising at Lockwood and Heinrich Lakes, and it turns out there are NO fish in Mill Lake. The trail was at best a goat path for the whole day. Not many miles but exhausting none the less."},{"src":"aviary-image-1599357161243.jpeg","caption":""},{"src":"aviary-image-1599357123884.jpeg","caption":""},{"src":"aviary-image-1599357296624.jpeg","caption":"For the end of August, the meadows were very lush."},{"src":"aviary-image-1599357232913.jpeg","caption":"The trail was deep in the weeds for the first couple of miles.
