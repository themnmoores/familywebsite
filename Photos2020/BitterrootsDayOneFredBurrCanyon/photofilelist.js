This would be the start of our three-day hike of the Fred Burr Canyon to Mill Creek Canyon loop. We had hoped to camp at about the 8-mile mark, but the Montana CCC group that was clearing the trail (thank goodness!) was camped there and campsites were not plentiful in the forested canyon bottom. We continued up the canyon, running into the CCC group, until we found a meadow that we could camp in.
