We could not hike it in 2019 as it is a National Recreation Area and was closed.  Personally I would give the nod to the Seven Falls hike in Bear Canyon, which is the next canyon from Sabino to the southwest. Both are beautiful."},{"src":"SabinoCanyon.png","caption":"The original plan was to take a shuttle bus up to the end of the road and start hiking from there. When we were buying tickets we found out that the next bus would be in 55 minutes and we decided to just start hiking up the canyon on the road. That turned out to be a beautiful hike and despite the crowds in the parking lot, on a Monday, it was not overly crowded while hiking. The shuttle bus we would have taken passed us in our last half mile of hiking to the turn around point."},{"src":"aviary-image-1580874023294.jpeg","caption":"We started towards the canyon on the road."},{"src":"aviary-image-1580873949613.jpeg","caption":"But then shifted to the trail that runs near the road for the first half mile or so."},{"src":"aviary-image-1580873908281.jpeg","caption":"A nice view of Rattlesnake Peak."},{"src":"aviary-image-1580873463124.jpeg","caption":"Actually for hiking the road was pretty nice.
