Here is a shot of Minneapolis across Lake Bde Maka Ska. Many have asked how Minneapolis is doing and I can say it is still a beautiful city with wonderful people that are moving forward. With all the conflict, disagreement, and discord going on in our country and on Facebook I have decided to post a picture I have taken that depicts something good every day as a reminder that the world is a good and beautiful place."},{"src":"118762712_10218715864227550_2971711100927226098_o.jpg","caption":"September 2: Hope and Confidence. Seeing the construction of two new baseball fields in Cottage Grove reminded me there is hope and that next summer baseball teams will be playing games with their family and friends gathered to watch."},{"src":"118780228_10218721933219271_1205697128103674014_o.jpg","caption":"September 3: Butterflies in Cottage Grove, whenever I see Butterflies it gives me a peaceful feeling and time seems to melt away. These flowers were attracting many Monarchs, it was a beautiful sight to watch them float between the flowers."},{"src":"118824381_10218729282002986_7317651909230678084_o.jpg","caption":"September 4: Clouds, after living in the midwest for 31 years I still never tire of watching the cotton ball clouds float through the blue skies."},{"src":"118692591_10218737759014906_1709629056153103367_o.jpg","caption":"September 5: Morning Mist, greeted us on the St Croix River to kick off a great day of kayaking from Interstate Park in Taylors Falls."},{"src":"118893581_10218742813021253_8622334323825519010_o.jpg","caption":"September 6: Floatilla, there were waves of people enjoying the beauty of the St Croix National Scenic Riverway yesterday."},{"src":"119004464_10218749128059125_5060789115746913839_o.jpg","caption":"September 7: Mississippi River Tug, I did not the Mississippi river to feel left out. Running right between the cities of St Paul and Minneapolis a few miles from our house the Mississippi is a working river and I marvel at watching the Tugboats working the river moving large barges up and down the river. The skill of the Tug captains and the power of the Tugs always leaves me awestruck."},{"src":"118922757_10218756214756288_2827432050033614541_o.jpg","caption":"September 8: Bike Trails, here in Minnesota we are blessed with many wonderful bike trails. Last Wednesday, Julie and I explored a new bike trail for us, the 9 Mile Creek Trail. Yes, it is hard to believe there is a trail we have not ridden. This trail runs through 5 different metro area cities and is a constantly changing variety of trail types that make it an interesting bike trail. The most interesting feature of the trail was the long boardwalks through many wetlands. If you are interested here is the route: https://ridewithgps.com/trips/55442725"},{"src":"119136760_10218761900418426_1120357151023958838_o.jpg","caption":"September 9: Parks, another blessing of the Twin Cities is the number of parks we have.

It is the section between highway 61 and Upper Afton road."},{"src":"119086851_10218768480342920_6680976190035811594_o.jpg","caption":"September 10: Montana, I grabbed this shot as we were leaving the Big Creek Trailhead at the end of our time in the Bitterroot Mountains.

I was riding along Battle Creek Lake when I saw a small group of these birds, Pied-Billed Grebes. At first, I thought they were Mallards but as I got closer I knew they were not Mallards but I had no idea what bird they were. Thanks to Nate Peterfeso for his help in identifying the type of bird!"},{"src":"119360234_10218782210606168_5229260121308137082_o (1).jpg","caption":"September 12: St Paul, I did not want to ignore the sleepy city of the Twin Cities. Although the skyline of St Paul has not changed much in the 31 years we have lived here that is okay as it is a quint river city. I was able to get this photo when the sun came out after we finished our bike ride that started at Harriot Island. The view of St Paul from Harriot Island in the afternoon is always spectacular."},{"src":"119449147_10218788915133777_7839337236417255340_o.jpg","caption":"September 13: Red Paintbrush, these unusual wildflowers were in full bloom a few weeks ago in the Bitterroot Mountains."},{"src":"119444375_10218795316573809_3362044650157658147_o.jpg","caption":"September 14: Goldenrod, as summer ends and fall begins the Goldenrod flowers come out to spread some beauty and pollen for the bees."},{"src":"119576274_10218801454207246_5253785722611198328_o.jpg","caption":"September 15: Laying in the Sun, with the cooler weather the turtles are coming out of the water to warm up."},{"src":"119603085_10218807276072789_8467329693938990768_o.jpg","caption":"September 16: Anticipation, many folks dread fall as it means that the green of summer will disappear and winter snow is coming. I love fall and look forward to it every year. The cool days are great for being in the outdoors and the fall colors add to the wonder of being immersed in nature\'s beauty. As a photographer, I hope to be able to capture that perfect fall color scenery shot."},{"src":"119215174_10218813928399093_2986779472710627003_o.jpg","caption":"September 17: Red Admiral Butterfly, this unique butterfly was very patient in waiting for me to stop biking, get my camera out, and take a picture of it before flying off."},{"src":"119878509_10218819813226210_2751512608988286906_o.jpg","caption":"September 18: Beauty in Darkness, a flash picture of the inside of one of the tunnels we had to walk through on the Elroy Sparta bike trail (considered the first rails to trails conversion in the United States)."},{"src":"119969918_10218826784680492_3240837296823220262_o.jpg","caption":"September 19: 400 Trail, we biked the 400 from Elroy to Reedsburg yesterday and it was a beautiful trail and day to be riding.

I pulled to the side of the road, with the trailer on the car, and stood in the middle of the road dodging traffic to get this shot. The return of the western forest fire haze provided a fiery sun (this was about 6:30 pm well before sunset)."},{"src":"119989023_10218840283937965_3475224564576919384_o.jpg","caption":"September 21: Americana Wisconsin style"},{"src":"119964913_10218845654192218_6266581548105766697_o.jpg","caption":"September 22: Milkweed Seeds"},{"src":"120048373_10218852988535572_8407889874014160675_o.jpg","caption":"September 23: Wayzata MN"},{"src":"120190306_10218858025101483_6745673107588221209_o.jpg","caption":"September 24: A taste of Venice in Stillwater MN"},{"src":"120217281_10218863797085779_6746839654322706919_o.jpg","caption":"September 25: Mississippi river fall colors are starting to really pop.
