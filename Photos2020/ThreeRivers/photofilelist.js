I asked them about the Petroglyph National Monument outside of Albuquerque, and they said it was nice but you could not get too close to the glyphs. Their recommendation was to skip that and go to the Three Rivers Petroglyph Site. This meant two-lane highway across some pretty barren terrain from Santa Fe to Three Rivers. This water vane looked pretty cool so I stopped for a quick picture.

The petroglyphs at Three Rivers, dating back to between about 900 and 1400 AD, were created by Jornada Mogollon people who used stone tools to remove the dark patina on the exterior of the rock. A small pueblo ruin is nearby and Sierra Blanca towers above to the east. "},{"src":"threerivers.png","caption":"We followed the trail almost to the end.
