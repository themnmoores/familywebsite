Given all the cars we did not really see that many other people on our hike. I am assuming some hiked the Deadman\'s Pass trail or Mescal trail. Both are beautiful trails we did last year."},{"src":"aviary-image-1581134956902.jpeg","caption":"Beautiful views just from the trailhead."},{"src":"boyntoncanyon.png","caption":"Boynton Canyon is a 6 mile-ish in and back hike as is typical of many canyons in the Sedona area. The first 2.5 miles are fairly mild for elevation gain. The last mile is more rugged and gains elevation. The last quarter of a mile is basically a rock scramble until you get to the end of the trail sign. It is worth the scramble as the views are the end of the canyon are stunning."},{"src":"aviary-image-1581134678272.jpeg","caption":"Entering into the wildness. There are two federal wilderness areas and a state park in the Sedona area."},{"src":"aviary-image-1581134611905.jpeg","caption":"Wonderful views as we get to the canyon entrance."},{"src":"aviary-image-1581134537263.jpeg","caption":"These two peaks were very present most of the hike except in the last mile of the canyon.

It was cold enough the waterfalls, what was of them, were frozen."},{"src":"aviary-image-1581089714880.jpeg","caption":"Looking up from our perch where we took in the canyon views and had a snack."},{"src":"aviary-image-1581089308172.jpeg","caption":"Looking back across the canyon."},{"src":"aviary-image-1581089384770.jpeg","caption":"We were in the sunlight, but only for a while."},{"src":"aviary-image-1581133692554.jpeg","caption":""},{"src":"aviary-image-1581089660935.jpeg","caption":"The north side of Bear Mountain.

Not many cars. I was expecting more as it is one of the easier trails in Sedona."},{"src":"faycanyon.png","caption":"We felt pretty good and decided to do Fay Canyon which is an easy 2.4-mile hike with not a lot of vertical.
