# familywebsite
This is simply a fun side project for a family website (themnmoores.net). I thought about using some tools or frameworks but since I am a long time coder that just retired I figured it would be good to keep some coding skills going and decided to hand roll a website. I tend to use Javascript to do all the common formatting. I guess CSS would do the same thing but I like doing it in Javascript. Feel free to use any of the code here, but realize it is not really tested that well and you will assume any liability for what happens by using the code. It might be nice to get some credit but not required.
