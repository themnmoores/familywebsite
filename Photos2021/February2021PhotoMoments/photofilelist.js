When the morning sun gets north of the house in the picture I know we are done with the 2 darkest months of winter."},{"src":"145481332_10219772072112087_6700599995606462377_o.jpg","caption":"February 3: Wolf Creek Falls in Banning State Park."},{"src":"146173160_10219780564244385_6818285596887210305_o.jpg","caption":"February 4: Cross country skiing at Giants Ridge in Biwabik MN."},{"src":"145887565_10219780562964353_3683892456726713418_o.jpg","caption":"February 4: Cross country skiing at Giants Ridge in Biwabik MN."},{"src":"146622848_10219789258181728_2512112886397317181_o.jpg","caption":"February 5: Snow bug. We kept seeing these bugs walking on the snow, mostly in the nordic tracks which meant they ended up being flattened. Looking on the internet, it seems this is more common than I would have expected."},{"src":"146141324_10219797838756237_2053498596699635128_o.jpg","caption":"February 6: Honk the Moose. Julie was hoping to see a moose while we were up in the Biwabik MN area. No live moose sightings and the best we did was a selfie with a statue in the Biwabik park. Honk, the Moose is the title of a children\'s book that is based on a true story of a moose who wandering into town during the winter of 1935 and spent the winter there."},{"src":"146199804_10219807277712205_6061059286077566556_o.jpg","caption":"February 7: Snowmobiles. When you head up north during the winter in Minnesota you will run into many snowmobilers. The Lodge at Giants Ridge even has a separate parking area for them. This is another winter activity I have not done in my 31 years in Minnesota. I prefer the quiet of Cross Country Skiing."},{"src":"147804534_10219813962719326_8763413473784888067_o.jpg","caption":"February 8: Unintended special effect. I was shooting in automatic mode with HDR enabled on my Lumix camera and got this ghosting effect of Julie skiing down a hill."},{"src":"148611815_10219819362814325_5583979193298696374_o.jpg","caption":"February 9: Coyote. We went for a short walk along the Mississippi yesterday to see what the eagles were doing. The eagles were in the trees staying warm, but we saw a pair of coyotes running along the opposite bank."},{"src":"147373293_10219825345403886_681301075050000612_o.jpg","caption":"February 10: Beautiful day for a ride (or walk). With the temps above 0F and warm sun, it was a good day to be out and about. When it is cold in Minnesota we are treated to clear blue skies."},{"src":"149087977_10219833991980045_8778378608242455873_o.jpg","caption":"February 11: TBT. Looking into Yosemite National Park (Virginia Canyon Creek) from Hoover Wilderness, 1974. We were headed to McCabe Lake behind the first ridge on the left which meant going down into the canyon and back up to the lake."},{"src":"148600970_10219840615585631_7701763015330900191_o.jpg","caption":"February 12: Cross Country Ski Race. It was nice to see a high school cross country ski race between three schools being held last week at Giants Ridge. We talked to one of the coaches for a bit and I gained an appreciation for the difficulties of holding a larger meet such as a section or state meet. I had thought just stagger the kids or send out smaller clusters but he mentioned the snow conditions would change between groups or skiers if there was a time gap. Yes, that is snow falling."},{"src":"149526194_10219847580599752_2008149742058002578_o.jpg","caption":"February 13: Red Fox. This fox came through the yard yesterday, I am not sure if it the same one I snapped some pictures of last fall. Its tail looked a bit chewed on, maybe it had tangled with some coyotes."},{"src":"149526192_10219855330753501_5391216225815377472_o.jpg","caption":"February 14: Finch. This picture was taken just before our current cold snap and it seemed like the bird had beefed up its feathering in preparation."},{"src":"149790599_10219863576679644_2372720201067804906_o.jpg","caption":"February 15: Because I could. I did my first sub 0F bike ride last Friday. Actually not too bad, the only problem was my goggles started to freeze on the inside after 5 miles. I had planned to do the ride last Thursday but by the time I got ready to head out the temperature had gotten up to 1F. I could take it another 10 degrees colder if I went for a ride right now but think I will wait for the warmer weather to come in a couple of days.

This is at the Glenshire trailhead of the Truckee River trail. It is an approximately 600-year-old Jeffery pine that died of old age."},{"src":"150086371_10219876527283401_3823550308662996428_o.jpg","caption":"February 17: Pardon me, do you have a morsel to share?"},{"src":"150752036_10219883171969514_588197653805827086_o.jpg","caption":"February 18: Cannon Valley Trail. With temperatures moderating, we went down to ski the Cannon Valley Trail before the predicted snow melting 40F temps arrive early next week. Had a nice ski and there were lots of waterfowl and other birds out."},{"src":"151057639_10219888944673828_6144635223779318456_o.jpg","caption":"February 19: Third time\'s a charm. On our third ski on the Cannon Valley Trail, we finally saw the trumpeter swans that winter on the river (along with geese and ducks)."},{"src":"150535227_10219888942433772_1598420222991765159_o.jpg","caption":"February 19: Third time\'s a charm.

With warm temperatures for the rest of the week (maybe even a bit of rain) I thought I would capture the backyard this morning with a dusting on new snow and then see how much snow is left on Saturday morning."},{"src":"153577253_10219914970884467_3148540168869075366_o.jpg","caption":"February 23: Last month as I was flying home from California I was treated to this for our descent into Minneapolis. Flying above the clouds always takes me back to my first airplane trip at the age of 6 from Toronto to Vancouver. I still remember being mesmerized by floating above the clouds and seeing the world pass by. I still love to get a window seat and just stare out as the plane flies."},{"src":"153582604_10219921732613506_934944061392343132_o.jpg","caption":"February 24: Mississippi River ice out. This section of the Mississippi River through St Paul can get ice jams and I was hoping to get a picture of that yesterday but it looks like the ice jams may not happen this year. Might head back over tomorrow to see."},{"src":"154711541_10219928065491824_5580170471808291425_o.jpg","caption":"February 25: TBT, Capri Italy 2014."},{"src":"153750428_10219934501652724_6238537884312211700_o.jpg","caption":"February 26: Automation. It seems like just a few years ago there would be 2-3 people involved in collecting the trash. One driving the truck and the others rolling the trash cans to the truck and either dumping the contents into the garbage truck or hooking the can to a lift system. Now only one person is needed, a reduction of 1 or 2 jobs to automation. As an engineer, I love automation but do realize it does cause an issue for society in the loss of jobs. Here is a video snippet: https://youtu.be/RUN0rSy6DcQ"},{"src":"155147437_10219941181819724_3045477172942904397_o.jpg","caption":"February 27: After 5 days of warmer weather there is some diminishing of the snowpack, but not as much as I was expecting. The depth and density of the snow must have been greater than I had estimated. Another warm sunny day should melt some more snow, but we have more snow arriving tonight."},{"src":"155353146_10219947188529888_8777681459659718373_o.jpg","caption":"February 28: Red Squirrel. With the warm weather yesterday, all sorts of creatures were out and about. This squirrel enjoyed a drink from our heated birdbath. I had only seen the red squirrel around recently so I assumed they hibernated more than the gray squirrels that had been out most of the winter. It turns out that neither the gray or red squirrels hibernate. Go figure."}]}'
