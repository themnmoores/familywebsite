There is anticipation for things to come; some weddings, hopefully some long trips later in the year, more hiking/biking adventures, maybe some healing for our country, and other hopes. I have also made enough trips around the sun to realize there will be rough spots and struggles in the year to come, but believe faith and determination will get us past them. Wishing you all the best in 2021!"},{"src":"134573918_10219513050356705_6075767287606392307_o.jpg","caption":"January 2: Enjoying a cross country ski on the Cannon Valley Trail on New Years Day.
