The road signs said the interstate was closed to accidents and to take alternative routes. Google maps suggested a more southerly route using US highway 60. Although longer and potentially more time we decided to take this route and the drive was very pleasant and devoid of traffic and snowy weather as you can see."},{"src":"photo_20190312_203614.jpg","caption":"As we are driving many hyperbolic dish receivers come into view, Julie looks it up and she says they are the VLA.

From the VLA website: The Very Large Array, one of the world\'s premier astronomical radio observatories, consists of 27 radio antennas in a Y-shaped configuration on the Plains of San Agustin fifty miles west of Socorro, New Mexico. Each antenna is 25 meters (82 feet) in diameter. The data from the antennas is combined electronically to give the resolution of an antenna 36km (22 miles) across, with the sensitivity of a dish 130 meters (422 feet) in diameter."},{"src":"photo_20190312_184841.jpg","caption":"We did run into some snow as we got higher in elevation, but no issues driving."},{"src":"photo_20190312_184755.jpg","caption":"Some of the roadside attractions."},{"src":"photo_20190312_184615.jpg","caption":"Springerville NM, surprisingly they had a McDonald\'s there and we stopped for a snack and to make hotel reservations for Sedona."},{"src":"photo_20190312_184710.jpg","caption":"Springerville NM"},{"src":"photo_20190312_184537.jpg","caption":"Springerville NM, Madonna of the Trail is a series of 12 identical monuments dedicated to the spirit of pioneer women in the United States.
