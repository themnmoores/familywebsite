It is a pretty easy drive on the interstate to Duluth and then highway 61 beyond Duluth. Our lodging was at Lutsen Resort (very nice) and we would finally drive all the way to the Canadian border on the north shore. Before this the furthest we had been was Grand Marais."},{"src":"aviary-image-1563047798039.jpeg","caption":"Between Duluth and Two Harbors we stopped at the highly recommended Scenic Cafe for lunch.

We had planned on hiking in Tettegouche State Park but blew right by it as we were driving. Must have been talking too much and enjoying the wildflowers on the side of the road.

Total distanced hiked was 3 miles with 228 feet of elevation gain/loss."},{"src":"66605237_10215256740351615_2205426356005634048_n.jpg","caption":"Temperance river near Lake Superior."},{"src":"66532146_10215256740791626_2108954205057187840_n.jpg","caption":"We seemed to have hit peak wildflower bloom time.
