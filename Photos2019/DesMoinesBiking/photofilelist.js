We had heard from many people that the High Trestle trail was the one to ride in Des Moines. Our original plan was to ride this the following day on our way home as it is a bit north of Des Moines. With the forecast calling for 30-40 MPH winds that day we decided it would be best to cross a high bridge with calmer conditions. Turned out to be a good plan as the wind was bad the following day."},{"src":"hightrestle.png","caption":"The High Trestle Bridge trail section we did. An out and back to Slater.

We had wanted to bike it the day we got to Des Moines but the high winds made us abandon our plans. Since the wind was picking up from the south we decided to ride the section from Perry southeast to Minburn. This section of the trail is basically a straight line."},{"src":"photo_20191017_191507.jpg","caption":"Heading out of Perry. The trail was basically this straight the whole way. Notice the windmill which was turning quite nicely due to stronger winds. Our ride out to Minburn was directly into the wind and a bit uphill making it a bit of a struggle.

Always good to end with the wind!"},{"src":"photo_20191017_191347.jpg","caption":"Grain elevators glistening in the afternoon sun."},{"src":"photo_20191017_191244.jpg","caption":"Minburn, grandma taking her grandson for a ride."},{"src":"photo_20191017_191021.jpg","caption":"The windmills where spinning."},{"src":"photo_20191017_190907.jpg","caption":"Back in Perry, the fall colors were just starting."},{"src":"desmoinesriver.png","caption":"For our last day of riding we planned on riding along the Des Moines river north of Des Moines into downtown. The winds were forecast to be strong (30-40 MPH) from the south later in the morning and this route would have us riding with a tailwind for the last half. It turned out that the trail was closed under the freeway and we improvised and headed up river to Saylorville Lake.
