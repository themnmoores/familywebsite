That stated a debate on the number of strides in 100 feet. I thought 30, he said 40. Then he started saying it was the historical highest water mark of the lake? We decided to simply pack up and go to Deer Lake. I was not real happy as the campsite was a great campsite (that had been obviously used many times that summer) and it was sunny and hot.
