Wednesday was to be the coldest day of our trip so we had designated it as our Bridges of Madison County day. We found the website: https://independenttravelcats.com/visiting-the-covered-bridges-of-madison-county-iowa to be useful. On many sites people talked about biking to the bridges so we brought our bikes with us hoping to bike to a few of the bridges. I will tell us that unless you have a fat tire bike and are use to riding on lose gravel roads the bridges are best seen by car."},{"src":"photo_20191016_213320.jpg","caption":"Imes Bridge which was built in 1870 over the Middle River and is the oldest of the covered bridges in Madison County. The bridge has been moved twice, first to Clinton Creek. Then in 1997, it was renovated and moved to a ravine near St. Charles where it still sits today. This is the easiest of the bridges to visit as it just off I35 and has paved road access."},{"src":"photo_20191016_213009.jpg","caption":"One of the beautiful stained glass windows in the Madison County visitors center in St. Charles."},{"src":"photo_20191016_212907.jpg","caption":""},{"src":"photo_20191016_212606.jpg","caption":"Roseman Bridge (also known as the Oak Grove Bridge) was built in 1883 over the Middle River by Harvey P.
