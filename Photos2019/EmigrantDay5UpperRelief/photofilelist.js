I would have to admit that 4 days of hiking without a rest day made for a sore and slower hike this day. The elevation gain was gradual and we ventured through many meadows that were wet and mosquito filled. The section around mile 4 was really bad and I had to put on the head net while hiking."},{"src":"aviary-image-1566241102189.jpeg","caption":"The unnamed creek we followed on the way out of Deer Lake was almost completely dry."},{"src":"aviary-image-1566241124434.jpeg","caption":"There was a CCC crew of about 30 young adults working on the trail, some of their handy work.
